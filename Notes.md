# Retro #2 - 2015-03-20

* Pairing was good.
* today more awkward than last time when in person
* Samir not used to lag
* technology worked well; no difficulties (except a few shortcuts)
* less "evil pairing", not pushing away design/impl decisions today
* Peter a bit tired, maybe paying less attention today
* Samir could not dominate due to the lag
* we found point to continue fast
* Samir felt good when ugly code got refactored, it felt like getting somewhere because it is more generic
* moving in good direction.
* at least one more time on this problem if there is more fun, or just TDD cycle.
