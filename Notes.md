* "so little code, so much work to test" - worked long for mock in test but implementation was trivial
* concerns about flow - used "bla bla" names first
* good communication
* good discussions
* it was a playing session
* constraints were emerging, not clear at beginning
* by extracting -> more names, so more concepts
* the 3rd session we rushed

Plan A: to continue the regular outside in kata, we we had planned to return to the point before
creating the universe and then move forward from there.

Plan B: continue with avoiding implementation decicions and mess around more with current way.

* Pairing was good.
* today more awkward than last time when in person
* Samir not used to lag
* technology worked well; no difficulties (except a few shortcuts)
* less "evil pairing", not pushing away design/impl decisions today
* Peter a bit tired, maybe paying less attention today
* Samir could not dominate due to the lag
* we found point to continue fast
* Samir felt good when ugly code got refactored, it felt like getting somewhere because it is more generic
* moving in good direction.
* at least one more time on this problem if there is more fun, or just TDD cycle.
