* "so little code, so much work to test" - worked long for mock in test but implementation was trivial
* concerns about flow - used "bla bla" names first
* good communication
* good discussions
* it was a playing session
* constraints were emerging, not clear at beginning
* by extracting -> more names, so more concepts
* the 3rd session we rushed

Plan A: to continue the regular outside in kata, we we had planned to return to the point before
creating the universe and then move forward from there.

Plan B: continue with avoiding implementation decisions and mess around more with current way.

* Pairing was good.
* today more awkward than last time when in person
* Samir not used to lag
* technology worked well; no difficulties (except a few shortcuts)
* less "evil pairing", not pushing away design/impl decisions today
* Peter a bit tired, maybe paying less attention today
* Samir could not dominate due to the lag
* we found point to continue fast
* Samir felt good when ugly code got refactored, it felt like getting somewhere because it is more generic
* moving in good direction.
* at least one more time on this problem if there is more fun, or just TDD cycle.

* again we "changed" direction, or at least looked at it from another angle
  Samir "we decided sth else was important"
* thanks for showing me shortcuts again
* most of the time in refactoring and we progressed well.
  it felt like real progress
* we took decisions fast, because similar mindsets today or one does not care
  one decision we could not decide, we left for later and never came back, which was also ok
* less awkward, maybe because much refactoring today
  - should we do more refactoring because we enjoy it more?
  - should we not do it because we are comfortable?
  we need a mix
  - maybe need to be explicit and aware of it and when one is tired/anxious, just "ask for some refactoring to relax"
* very nice
* Samir had more lag the second half, difficult to type


# Retro #4 - 2015-05-18

* Peter likes the functional Java Samir does
* mood was good
* interesting questions, noted as comments, good discussions in the breaks, too
* Peter bit tired, so asked Samir to work
* taking notes is helpful, even in code
* asking questions and explaining though process helps.
